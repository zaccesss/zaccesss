I am an aspiring engineer and technologist with interests across **electronics, software development, cyber security, cloud computing, AI/ML, computer systems and hardware-software integration**.  

My journey began in **Ghana** where curiosity and problem solving shaped me early. In 2022 I moved to the **UK** during my final year at **Adisadel College** where I served as an aspiring Dispensary Prefect and Vice President of **APOSA**. That transition strengthened resilience, adaptability and responsibility which drive how I work and learn today.

I am sight impaired due to retinoblastoma in childhood which resulted in blindness in my right eye. Instead of limiting me it sharpened my discipline, consistency and determination to succeed academically and personally. I now study **Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Aston University** building experience in both hardware and software.

## 🧠 Technical Development

My technical development includes **C, C++, Python and Java** with knowledge of **microcontrollers, embedded systems, IoT fundamentals, PCB design, MATLAB, debugging and algorithmic thinking**.  

I am also expanding skills in **HTML, CSS, cloud computing, basic AI systems, cyber security and game development engines**. I enjoy understanding how systems function internally and building projects that move from **concept to code to real output**.

One example is my **4×4×4 NeoPixel LED Cube** which blends C++ logic, power budgeting and prototyping.
