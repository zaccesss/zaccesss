# Hi, I'm **Isaac (Zac) Adjei**
Engineer & Technologist

I am an aspiring engineer and technologist with interests that span across **electronics, software development, cyber security, cloud computing, AI/ML, computer systems and hardware-software integration.** My journey began in Ghana where curiosity and problem solving shaped me early. In 2022 I moved to the UK during my final year at Adisadel College where I served as an aspiring Dispensary Prefect and Vice President of APOSA. That transition strengthened resilience, adaptability and responsibility which drive how I work and learn today.

I am sight impaired due to retinoblastoma in childhood which resulted in blindness in my right eye. Instead of limiting me it sharpened my discipline, consistency and determination to succeed academically and personally. I now study **Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Aston University** building experience in both hardware and software.

## 🧠 Technical Development

My technical development includes **C, C++, Python and Java** with knowledge of microcontrollers, embedded systems, IoT fundamentals, PCB design, MATLAB, debugging and algorithmic thinking. I am also expanding skills in **HTML, CSS, cloud computing, basic AI systems, cyber security and game development engines.**

I enjoy understanding how systems function internally and building projects that move from concept to code to real output. My **4×4×4 NeoPixel LED Cube** reflects this blend through C++ logic, power budgeting and prototyping.

## 📌 Experience

My experience spans **engineering, tech, administration and hospitality.**

- **British Airways Engineering Simulation**  
  Virtual experience exploring maintenance planning, risk, data interpretation and reporting.

- **Yunex Traffic Smart Mobility & Digital Tech**  
  Exposure to intelligent transport systems, sensors, smart mobility and sustainability.

- **Ghana High Commission – Consular and Administrative roles**  
  Worked with documentation, passports and visas while developing diplomacy, organisation, documentation and communication skills.

- **Hospitality roles in London**  
  Waiter, food runner and bar back roles which strengthened teamwork, customer service, focus and performance under pressure across busy environments.

Each role shaped me into an **adaptable analytical learner** who can switch between people facing environments and technical engineering work.

## 🎧 Outside Engineering

Outside academics I learn through online courses, personal builds/projects and self development.  
I enjoy:

- Playing **piano**  
- The **gym** and fitness  
- **Cycling**  
- **Cooking**  
- Structured routines that strengthen discipline mentally and physically  

For me, growth is not occasional but an **active lifestyle**.

## 🎯 What I Am Looking For

I am seeking **internships, placements and work experience** across engineering and tech including:

- Embedded systems  
- Software development  
- Cloud computing  
- AI and automation  
- IoT and cyber aligned computing  

My long term goal is to build a career where **intelligent software and efficient hardware solve real problems** at scale.

If you value someone who **learns fast, thinks deeply, adapts quickly and contributes well both independently and in a team**, I would be happy to connect, collaborate and one day join your team.
