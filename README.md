# Hi, I'm **Isaac (Zac) Adjei**  
Engineer & Technologist | Electronic & Computer Engineering

I am an engineer with a passion for **embedded systems, circuits, IoT, cyber security and AI/ML**, with a growing foundation across software, microcontrollers and intelligent hardware-software integration. My journey started in Ghana, where discipline, curiosity and problem-solving shaped my character early. Moving to the UK strengthened my resilience and responsibility, and today I study **Electronic & Computer Engineering** pursuing innovation that blends both hardware and code.

I am sight-impaired (monocular vision) from childhood retinoblastoma, but instead of limiting me, it built discipline, consistency and focus. I believe engineering should *serve*, solve real problems and create systems that think, respond and improve lives.
