# 👋 Hi, I'm Isaac (Zac) Adjei  

Engineer-in-training focused on **embedded systems, circuits, IoT, and intelligent hardware-software integration**.  
My journey began in Ghana, where curiosity, faith and problem-solving shaped my character. Today I'm studying **Electronic & Computer Engineering** at **Aston University**, blending firmware, hardware logic and software development to build systems that think, respond and solve real problems.
