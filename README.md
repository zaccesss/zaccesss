## 👤 About Me

I am an aspiring engineer and technology enthusiast with interests that span across electronics, software development, cyber security, cloud computing, AI/ML, computer systems and hardware-software integration. My journey began in Ghana where curiosity and problem solving shaped me early. In 2022 I moved to the UK during my final year at Adisadel College where I served as an aspiring Dispensary Prefect and Vice President of APOSA. That transition strengthened resilience, adaptability and responsibility which drive how I work and learn today.

I am sight impaired due to retinoblastoma in childhood which resulted in blindness in my right eye. Instead of limiting me it sharpened my discipline, consistency and determination to succeed academically and personally. I now study Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Aston University building experience in both hardware and software.

## 🧠 Technical Development

My technical development includes **C, C++, Python and Java** with knowledge of **microcontrollers, embedded systems, IoT fundamentals, PCB design, MATLAB, debugging and algorithmic thinking**.

I am also expanding knowledge and skills in **HTML, CSS, cloud computing, basic AI systems, cyber security and game development engines**. I enjoy understanding how systems function internally and building projects that move from **concept to code to real output**.

One example is my **4×4×4 NeoPixel LED Cube** which blends C++ logic, power budgeting and prototyping.

## 🚀 Projects

### NeoPixel LED Cube | 4×4×4 Arduino Prototype

Designed and delivered a working 4×4×4 NeoPixel LED cube with 64 WS2812B LEDs on Arduino Uno. I led the software and supported the full build across wiring, enclosure and basic power budgeting.

Firmware in C++ using Adafruit_NeoPixel with a modular nonblocking state machine driven by `millis`.  
Debounced momentary buttons for power and mode select, buzzer beeps for power and mode changes and serial diagnostics for testing.

Ambient light sensing with an LDR, mapped and constrained to set LED brightness for visibility and sensible power use.

Four selectable patterns: colour wipe, smooth RGB fade, fire effect and rainbow cycle, each written as clean functions that are easy to extend.

Hardware support included soldering the 4×4×4 lattice, routing grounds and data lines, choosing a 5 V supply with headroom and fitting a simple wooden enclosure with front panel controls.

Testing covered LED smoke tests, button bounce checks and short demo runs to verify thermals and stability.

Deliverables included code, build photos, slides and notes so others can reproduce or add new effects.

**Tech used:** Arduino Uno, C++, Adafruit_NeoPixel, WS2812B, LDR, push buttons, piezo buzzer, 5 V PSU.
